       <p>
           Hello; <br>
           a Human being's biogrpahy shouldn't be listied in a paragrph<br>
           but heres a keypoints in my humble 30years spended on palnet Earth. <br>
           I never though of studing computer at collage because I thought I knew everything I needed about it.
           So when I majored in Software I was actully surprised of how little things that I knew!
           I fell in love with software at my graduation project where I coded something for my own and it was really good.
           After Grduation ,I didnt have much on my plate,and being from a small Hometown I couldn't find a job that would make me grow in software so i choose<br>
           teaching as a last resort.
           Now am extremly delighted to be in this course I hope to grow <br>
           and acomplish what I wanted.
           I am also Found of reading books and novels.
